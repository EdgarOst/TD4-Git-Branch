Many times, when working with Git, you may want to revise your local commit history. One of the great things about Git is that it allows you to make decisions at the last possible moment. You can decide what files go into which commits right before you commit with the staging area, you can decide that you didnâ€™t mean to be working on something yet with git stash, and you can rewrite commits that already happened so they look like they happened in a different way. You must indicate how far back you want to rewrite commits by telling the command which commit to rebase onto.
